## How to run

### Environment

You need to have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) and [Redis](https://redis.io/) installed.

Run the services needed(MongoDB, Elasticsearch and Redis) before going next step.

### Start the website

#### Data Worker

Under ./Worker

```bash
node worker.js
```

#### API Server

Under ./APIServer

```bash
node app.js
```

#### Front End Server

Under ./FrontEnd

```bash
npm start
```

#### To seed some initial data

Under ./Worker

```bash
node seed.js
```

## About the front end

We recorded a video to introduce the front end technology, and showing a running demo to introduce the website.

## About the back end

### Data worker

We use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) as our main database. A data module is constructed to realize MongoDB CRUD operations. A worker is constructed to wait for CRUD requests from the API server, and do works using the data module, then return responses. These requests and responses are sent over the [Redis](https://redis.io/) pub/sub setup.

### API server

An API server is constructed to provide the RESTful APIs for the front end. The API server accepts the requests from the front end, and send a meesage to the worker. After the worker returns the message, the API server then will send a response back to the front end.

### Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) is a powerful search and analytics engine. We apply Elasticsearch to provide advanced search options on search in movies.

When a movie is created, or updated in the main database, a copy will be persisted in the Elasticsearch. Search methods will be called from data module when executing advanced search, and return information to the data module. The final search result will then be assembled in the data module and returned to upper layer.

### ImageMagick

We use [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) to process the pictures uploaded by users. The pictures will be converted into a proper format and saved.
